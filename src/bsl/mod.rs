//! Contains all blockhain objects parsed from byte slices.
//!
//! Everyone of this objects keep the byte slice from which they were parsed, so "deserialization"
//! is free.
//!
//! Everyone of this object doesn't offer iteration of the contents on purpose, doing so would mean
//! deserialize the object more than once or allocating. Instead if you want to operate on the
//! parsed values you need to implement a [`crate::Visitor`].
//!
//! Other than the slice from they have been created these object may contain fields that are needed
//! from the caller without requiring re-parsing.
